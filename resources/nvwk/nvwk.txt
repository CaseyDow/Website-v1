<h1>How to Play</h1>
<h2>Order of Play:</h2>
On the first round the dealer starts. When a round ends, the loser, the person with the most points, starts. This continues clockwise and the next person will play a card. Singles have to be played on singles, doubles on doubles, and so on. The card order starts going up, and only cards higher than the previous card can be played unless specified. It is the opposite when the order goes down. When a round ends, the person who last played can play on their card again or start a new round with whatever they want.
<h2>Winning:</h2>
The person with the least amount of points left once someone has no cards left is the winner. Additionally, if someone gets negative three points including the points in their hand and points played on them, they instantly win. The game will also end if there are no cards left to draw or reshuffle.
<h2>Dealing and Shuffling:</h2>
The appropriate amount of cards is dealt to each person to start the game. Whenever there is no more cards in the deck to pick from, the play pile is shuffled, becoming the deck.
<h2>Taking Cards:</h2>
When a card is played, if the same number is played on it, then the next person has to take two cards. If the next person has the same card or gets the card after picking, they can make the next person draw three cards and so on. For doubles, two times the cards are taken and so on. If three or more consecutive cards are played in a row, the next person will take the amount of cards played in a row. When the deck is reshuffled, all straits and cards in a row are ended so no one can take from it. Consecutive cards and straights can give cards even after someone has picked. Also the cards taken at once is limited. For singles, the most someone can take at once is four. It is doubled for doubles, tripled for triples, and so on. This will also apply to straits, but do not apply to the cards taken from sixes or the nine of hearts.
<h2>Evolving and Devolving:</h2>
To evolve or devolve, someone must play the card or cards next in the sequence. When evolving, doubles are played on singles, triples on doubles and so on. Also, the cards played need to be even. Devolving is the opposite and someone must play an odd number to devolve. Aces are both odd and even so they can evolve and devolve. Evolving and devolving also work in a circle around the card order with twos and aces.
<h2>Trading:</h2>
Before every round, the winner of the previous round asks the loser for a number. The loser has to give the card if they can, but can choose which if they have multiple of the number. The winner will continue to ask until they have taken a card and then they will return a card of their choice. Second place will randomly take a card from second to last and will give back a card. It may be the same card.
